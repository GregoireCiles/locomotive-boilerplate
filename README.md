## Getting started

Make sure you have the following installed:

* [Node] â€” at least 14.17, the latest LTS is recommended.
* [NPM] â€” at least 6.0, the latest LTS is recommended.

> ðŸ’¡ You can use [NVM] to install and use different versions of Node via the command-line.

```sh
# Clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-boilerplate.git my-new-project

# Enter the newly-cloned directory.
cd my-new-project
```

Then replace the original remote repository with your project's repository.

Then update the following files to suit your project:
